# TeamUSEC

We are a research group that focuses on the intersection of computer security, privacy, and human factors. Our team is interested in studying end users, administrators, developers, and designers of computer systems and how they interact with security and privacy mechanisms.

Our research involves large-scale analyses of the Internet and software repositories to understand the huge challenges humans face when interacting with computer security and privacy mechanisms.

To understand root causes, evaluate existing mechanisms and investigate novel ideas, we conduct all kinds of user studies with end users, administrators, and developers of these systems. By doing so, we hope to improve the overall security and privacy of computer systems.
